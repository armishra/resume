\section{Education}

\cventry{2015 -- 2019}{University of California, San Diego}{}
{B.S. Computer Science}{GPA -- 3.80} {Expected Graduation: June 2019}

\section{Experience}
\cventry{Facebook}{Software Engineering Intern}{}{}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on the Database Engineering team on the MySQL storage engine
        MyRocks, which integrates RocksDB as a backend for MySQL.
    \item Added system information to RocksDB and MyRocks to report
      transactional deadlocks under the engine's transaction status query.
    \item Implemented crash safety for auto incrementing values in MyRocks by
        modifying the storage engine's data dictionary format.
    \item Cached in memory auto increment value thereby speeding up a specific
        slow query up to 9 times and preventing a full table scan.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Excelfore Inc}{Software Development Intern}{}{}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Integrated vehicle IOT services with a low latency video camera stream in C++.
    \item Sped up face detection algorithm by 200\% by implementing a
      prediction algorithm on a 30 MB/s video streaming pipeline.
    \item Improved lane tracking application by minimizing calculations done
      per lane candidate leading to a 70\% speed up.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{UCSD CSE Department}{CS Tutor/Lab Lead}{}{}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Taught CSE 12/15L/110 - CS tutor for Data Structures, UNIX Lab, and
      Software Engineering under professor Gary Gillespie.
    \item Assisted students in building high performance data structures such
      as Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Stacks, and Linked Lists in C, C++, and
      Java.
\end{itemize}}

\section{Projects}

\cventry{Summer 2017}{Facebook MyRocks}{}{}{}{Open Source Contributor
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Contributed to Facebook's open source MyRocks repository, a fork of MySQL 5.6.35.
    \item Added statistical counters for deadlock and lock wait timeouts and
      amended InnoDB table statistics update bug.
    \item Added diagnostic error messages for distinguishing between types of
      database deadlocks.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Summer 2017}{Facebook RocksDB}{}{}{}{Open Source Contributor
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Contributed to Facebook's RocksDB, an embedded key value store.
    \item Added deadlock tracking infrastructure to display the path upon which
      a deadlock occured.
    \item Designed efficient buffer to store the n latest deadlocks that
      is currently exposed by MyRocks' engine transaction status command.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Winter 2016}{Java Distributed File System}{}{}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a distributed file system in Java that is optimized for
      storing and retrieving many smaller data files.
    \item Designed system to chunk and send files over the network using Java's
      standard library sockets.
  \end{itemize}
}
